Entry and exit criteria

Entry criteria: Complete development of features, availability of test environment, and test data.
Exit criteria: All critical and high-priority defects fixed, test cases executed successfully, and acceptance criteria met.
Test environment and tools

Test environment: AWS cloud-based environment with Linux servers and browsers (Chrome, Firefox).
Tools: Selenium WebDriver for browser automation, JUnit for test execution, Apache JMeter for performance testing, OWASP ZAP for security testing.
Risk analysis

Identified risks include time constraints for testing, potential scalability issues under heavy loads, and security vulnerabilities due to data breaches.

Part 2: Test Case Design
Functional Test Cases

User Registration

Positive case: Successful registration with valid data
Negative case: Registration with invalid data (e.g., invalid email format)
Product Search

Positive case: Search for a product and verify results
Negative case: Search for a non-existing product and verify no results
Add to Cart and Checkout Process

Positive case: Add items to the cart and complete checkout
Negative case: Attempt to checkout with an empty cart
Edge and Boundary Test Cases

User Registration

Boundary: Maximum length for username, email, and password fields
Edge: Special characters in username and password fields
Product Search

Edge: Search with minimum and maximum character limits
Boundary: Search with special characters and numbers
Add to Cart and Checkout Process

Boundary: Add maximum number of items to the cart
Edge: Checkout with a minimum amount payable
Part 3: Test Automation
Test Automation Framework

Selenium WebDriver is chosen for its robust support for web application testing and cross-browser compatibility. It allows for automation of web browsers and supports various programming languages like Java, which is suitable for our team's skillset.
Automated Test Scripts

User Registration

Positive case: Verify successful registration
Negative case: Verify error messages for invalid registration data
Product Search

Positive case: Verify search results
Negative case: Verify no results found for invalid searches
Add to Cart and Checkout Process

Positive case: Verify successful checkout
Negative case: Verify checkout with an empty cart
Test Data Management

Test data will be managed using CSV files stored in a dedicated test data directory. Scripts will read and parse these files to input data into test scenarios.
